Marijuana may get a bad rep in the media as far as the decriminalization debate goes, but its health benefits can no longer go unnoticed. With various studies linking long-term marijuana use to positive, health-related effects, there are more than just a few reasons to smoke some weed every day.

A study done by the Boston Medical Center and the Boston University of Medicine, examined 589 drug users—more than 8 out of 10 of whom were pot smokers. It determined that “weed aficionados” were no more likely to visit the doctor than non-drug users. If an increased risk of contracting ailments is what’s preventing you from smoking more weed, it looks like you’re in the clear!

One of the greatest medicinal benefits of marijuana is its pain relieving qualities, which make it especially effective for treating chronic pain. From menstruation cramps to nerve pain, as little as three puffs of bud a day can help provide the same relief as synthetic painkillers. Marijuana relieves pain by “changing the way the nerves function,” says Mark Ware, MD and assistant professor of anesthesia and family medicine at McGill University.

Studies have found that patients suffering from arthritis could benefit from marijuana use. This is because naturally occurring chemicals in cannabis work to activate pathways in the body that help fight off joint inflammation.

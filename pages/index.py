            #### **üå≥ WHICH STRAINS OF MARIJUANA ARE BEST SUITED FOR YOU?**

            Have you ever bought some green from your local dispensary and wondered why recommended a strain?

            Unless you use a machine learning tool such as this one, you're usually going to be stuck testing every strain until you find the one that works.

            After interactively experimenting with MedCabinet+, hopefully you'll more clearly understand the differences between different strains of weed.
